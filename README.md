# Celer State Guardian Network

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/celer-network/sgn/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/celer-network/sgn/tree/master)

Official implementation of the [Celer State Guardian Network (SGN)](https://www.celer.network/docs/celercore/sgn/architecture.html) V1.

**DEPRECATED**: SGN V1 has been deprecated. Please stay tuned for the open source repo of SGN V2.

## Run local tests

Please follow the [local test instructions](./test/README.md) to test SGN and get familiar with the validator CLI operations on your machine.

## Join the public networks

Both SGN mainnet and testnet are up and running.

Please refer to instructions in [sgn-networks](https://github.com/celer-network/sgn-networks/) to see how to [run a validator](https://github.com/celer-network/sgn-networks/blob/master/docs/validator.md), how to [operate as a delegator](https://github.com/celer-network/sgn-networks/blob/master/docs/delegator.md), and how to [test as a state channel client](https://github.com/celer-network/sgn-networks/blob/master/docs/test_user.md).
