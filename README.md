## Run Local Tests

Please follow the [local test instructions](./test/README.md) to test SGN on your machine.

## Ropsten Testnet

SGN beta testnet is [launched](https://blog.celer.network/2020/08/10/state-guardian-network-beta-testnet-launches/). It is using the Ropsten network as the layer-1 mainchain. Please [sign up here](https://yj20.typeform.com/to/wfrAngwE) to receive testnet CELR tokens as delegators, and [sign up here](https://yj20.typeform.com/to/U9UHcaDa) if you want to become a validator.

Please refer to instructions in the [docs folder](./docs) to see how to [run a validator](./docs/ropsten_validator_manual.md), how to [test as a state channel client](./docs/ropsten_test_user_manual.md), and how to do other operations through CLI commands.

The testnet is launched in two consecutive phases.

**Phase 1 testnet** has already started and will last till late August 2020, during which anyone is welcome and appreciated to test and provide feedback to the Celer team. As bug fixes and feature improvements are expected, there may be unplanned downtime or full network reset.

**Phase 2 testnet** will start in late August 2020, when the network becomes more stable. We will launch a bug bounty program and reward program to ensure the reliability of the upcoming phase 1 mainnet launch. The details of the bug bounty program will be released later.
